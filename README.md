# Contact Manager

A simple contact manager.

Was fun to play with the following:
- simple data management (create, reading, updating, deleting contact entries)
- allowing multiple users with their own set of contacts
  - i.e. users cannot see another users contacts, only their own
- implementing bcrypt for passwords
- very basic data validation (correct phone/email format, etc.)
- getting comfortable with writing test before and during the development process, and using them actively to test ideas
